# Gamble_Script

I made this project to pratice my logic and learn more. It's a simple script.
First u deposit some money, you put in an amount, then choose the number of lines to bet on (1-5), next u put the money bet per line. Finnaly the script is executed.

Example:

E | A | A | E | D


You won, $0. Do you want to play again (y/n)?

for you to win some money you need to be lucky to hit 5 in a row : A | A | A | A | A


The package I used was the prompt-sync, the command to install on node is (npm i prompt-sync), this is a package to collect user inputs.
